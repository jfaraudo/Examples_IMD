# Examples_IMD
Examples of Interactive Molecular Dynamics simulations for VDM-NAMD based on the [official NAMD tutorials](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/#namd).
Examples available:
- Simulation of water inside a nanotube
- Simulation of a protein

We also provide example python scripts using MDAnalysis to analyze the trajectories (see [here](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/quickstart.html) for a tutorial on How to Use MD Analysis)
